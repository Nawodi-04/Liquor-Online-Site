		<h1>History Of Arrack</h1>
		<pre><p>The etymology of the word ‘arrack’ has always left room for some doubt ‒ partly because it has been around for a very long time.What’s more, 
		the word is also used in different parts of South and Southeast Asia, to describe local beverages made from the fermented sap from various 
		sources ‒ fruit, sugarcane, grain etc. ‒  depending on the country in question. In Sri Lanka, ‘arrack’ is the much-loved local drink, distilled 
		from the sap of the coconut flower.
		<br><br>
		Historical records of toddy and arrack can be traced back to 5th century A.D, however it is safe to assume
        that the spirit has been around for much longer. The Kings had small coconut plantations of their own, and 
		were producing their own toddy and arrack for personal consumption. Internationally, the conversion of fruit 
		to alcohol requires adding yeast, but the Sri Lankans of long ago fermented their toddy differently. The sap 
		of the coconut was extracted and stored in the morning, letting the heat of the day  spark the airborne yeast, 
		resulting in fermentation. Therefore, fermentation of arrack already existed prior to colonisation, without the use
		of additional yeast or other ingre dients used by the Dutch and the British.
		<br><br>
		 Today, in Sri Lanka, alcohol consumption has become a 
		 growing health issue, especially amongst men. There are also concerns that more adolescents and young adults will take on this habit in spite
		 of the legal drinking age being 21. In the recent past, going by sales records, beer was believed to be the most consumed
		 alcoholic beverage amongst Sri Lankans. In 2003, 19.3 million litres of beer was produced in the country and in 2007 there was a
		 53 percent increase in sales. The trend was is correlation to the price of the alcoholic beverage, as it was one of the cheaper alcoholic beverages 
		 in Sri Lanka. To reduce the consumption of beer, in 2016 the current Government implemented a 27 percent tax increase on mild beer and a 32 percent
		 tax increase on strong beer. By the end of 2016, there was another increase, resulting in a 70 percent increase overall. This resulted 
		 in a fall in beer sales; however, tax on arrack, Sri Lanka’s famous local alcoholic beverage, although possessing a higher alcohol concentration, was only increased by 24 percent.
		 Taxes notwithstanding, there has been a 10 percent increase in arrack sales.
		 <br><br>
		With a rich history and a creative art of production, Ceylon arrack is now loved internationally.
		It is fascinating indeed, how a beverage of ancient times has remained popular to this day.</p></pre>
